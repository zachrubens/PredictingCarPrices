# Predicting Car Prices Machine Learning Project
In this project, I'm going to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set that will be used contains information on various cars and for each car we have info about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, weight of the car, miles per gallon, how fast the care accelerates, and how likely the car will be in a fast & furious movie (just kidding). You can read more about the dataset here if you'd like.

Let's read in the dataset.
